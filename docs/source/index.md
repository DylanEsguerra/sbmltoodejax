# Welcome to SBMLtoODEjax!

SBMLtoODEjax is a lightweight library that allows to automatically parse Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and convert them into 
python modules that can then easily be simulated in python projects, and manipulated based on one‚Äôs needs.


SBMLtoODEjax builds upon the [SBMLtoODEpy](https://github.com/AnabelSMRuggiero/sbmltoodepy) package which shares similar purpose, but it has two key differences:
1. SBMLtoODEjax library is written end-to-end in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) which opens up new possibilities for performant, batchable and differentiable simulations of SBML models
   (See [üëÄ Why use SBMLtoODEjax?](./design_principles.md)).
2. The python files generated by SBMLtoODEjax follow different conventions than standard SBML conventions, with more generic *variables* and *modules*.
The aim is to allow intuitive and flexible manipulations while preserving JAX-like functional programming (See [üé® Design Principles](./design_principles.md)).

## Quick start

:::{admonition} Install
:class: note
SBMLtoODEjax can be installed via pip. See our [Installation](./installation.md) guide for further details.
```bash
pip install sbmltoodejax
```
:::

:::{admonition} Begin
:class: seealso
Go have a look at our [Numerical Simulation](./tutorials/biomodels_curation.ipynb) tutorial to learn how to load and simulate SBML models.
