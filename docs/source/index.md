# Welcome to SBMLtoODEjax!

SBMLtoODEjax project builds upon the [SBMLtoODEpy](https://github.com/AnabelSMRuggiero/sbmltoodepy) project which allows to convert
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models into python classes that can then easily be
simulated (and manipulated based on one's need) in python projects.

At the difference of SBMLtoODEpy, SBMLtoODEjax library is written end-to-end in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) 
and with different [design principles](./design_principles.md).

## Quick start

:::{admonition} Install
:class: note
SBMLtoODEjax can be installed via pip. See our [Installation](./installation.md) guide for further details.
```bash
pip install sbmltoodejax
```
:::

:::{admonition} Begin
:class: seealso
Go have a look at our [Numerical Simulation](./tutorials/biomodels_curation.ipynb) tutorial to learn how to load and simulate SBML models.
